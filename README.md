Algorithms & Design Project

This repository contains my project submission for Algorithms & Design, which received a score of 81%. The project involved applying algorithmic problem-solving techniques in C to real-world inspired scenarios based on manufacturing production line logs.

Across four main tasks, I explored different approaches to efficiency and data handling. 

In the first task, I created a data structure for QA logs and implemented Merge Sort to order them by product ID, issue code, and timestamp, meeting the O(N log N) runtime requirement.

The second task focused on efficient storage, where I used a circular queue to report issue codes by product and line ID in O(N) time. 

For the third task, I combined Quick Sort with Binary Search to identify the earliest occurrence of an issue code for a given product, achieving logarithmic search efficiency. 

The final task required a summary of issues per product ID, which I implemented with a simple linear scan to maintain O(N) performance.

Through this project I gained practical experience in designing and analyzing algorithms with varying time complexities, from O(N) to O(N log N) and O(log N). I also developed my skills in C programming, working with structs, queues, and custom sorting and searching implementations. The project gave me a deeper understanding of the importance of efficiency and the trade-offs between brute-force and optimized solutions when working with large datasets.
